## 🚀 Get Started in Seconds!

Get up and running in three simple steps:

### Step 1: Run the Docker image
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/browserless/chromium
```
### Step 2: Open the docs in your browser
Visit http://localhost:3000/docs

**✅ Success!** Your browser service is live at `ws://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Connect your script with Puppeteer or Playwright

<details open>
<summary><b>📘 Puppeteer Example</b></summary>

```js
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';

const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
  browserWSEndpoint: 'ws://localhost:3000',
});

const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://example.com');
console.log(await page.title());
await browser.close();
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎭 Playwright Example</b></summary>

```js
import pw from 'playwright-core';

const browser = await pw.firefox.connect(
  'ws://localhost:3000/firefox/playwright'
);

const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://example.com');
console.log(await page.title());
await browser.close();
```

 **Note:** Use `ghcr.io/browserless/firefox` or `ghcr.io/browserless/multi` for Firefox/Webkit support.

## ✨ Features

### General Features

- **Parallelism and queueing** — Handle multiple sessions with configurable concurrency limits
- **Debug Viewer** — Actively view and debug running browser sessions in real-time
- **Unforked libraries** — Works seamlessly with standard Puppeteer and Playwright
- **Fonts & emoji** — All system fonts and emoji support out-of-the-box
- **Configurable timeouts** — Set session timers and health-checks to keep things running smoothly
- **Error tolerant** — If Chrome crashes, Browserless won't
- **ARM64 architecture support** — Full support for ARM64 platforms including Apple Silicon; some browsers (Edge, Chrome) have limited ARM64 compatibility

### Premium Features

Our [Self-serve cloud and Enterprise offerings](https://www.browserless.io/pricing/) include all the general features plus extras, such as:

- **[BrowserQL](https://www.browserless.io/feature/browserql)** for avoiding detectors and solving captchas
- **[Hybrid automations](https://docs.browserless.io/baas/interactive-browser-sessions/hybrid-automation)** for streaming live browser sessions during scripts
- **[Persistent Sessions](https://docs.browserless.io/baas/session-management/persisting-state)** for persisting browser state (cookies, cache, localStorage) across multiple sessions with configurable data retention up to 90 days
- **[Session Replay](https://docs.browserless.io/baas/interactive-browser-sessions/session-replay)** for recording and debugging browser sessions with event capture and video playback
- **[Chrome Extensions Support](https://docs.browserless.io/baas/features/browser-extensions)** for loading custom extensions including ad blockers, captcha solvers, etc.

- **[Inbuilt residential proxy](https://www.browserless.io/blog/residential-proxying/)** for automatic IP rotation and geo-targeting with residential proxy networks
- **[/smart-scrape API](https://docs.browserless.io/rest-apis/smart-scrape)** for intelligently scraping any URL using cascading strategies (HTTP fetch, proxy, headless browser, captcha solving)
- **[/crawl API](https://docs.browserless.io/rest-apis/crawl)** for asynchronously crawling entire websites and scraping every discovered page into structured, LLM-ready data
- **[/map API](https://docs.browserless.io/rest-apis/map)** for discovering all URLs on a website via sitemaps and link extraction, with search-based relevance ranking
- **[/search API](https://docs.browserless.io/rest-apis/search)** for searching the web and optionally scraping each result page into structured formats (markdown, HTML, links, or screenshots)
- **[MCP Server](https://docs.browserless.io/mcp/overview)** for connecting AI assistants (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf) directly to Browserless browser automation
- **[Webhook Integrations](https://docs.browserless.io/enterprise/docker/webhooks)** for queue alerts, rejections, timeouts, errors, and health failures

## 🤖 MCP Server

Browserless offers an [MCP (Model Context Protocol) server](https://docs.browserless.io/mcp/overview) that lets AI assistants connect directly to the Browserless platform. Give your LLM the ability to scrape pages, search the web, crawl websites, take screenshots, generate PDFs, and run Lighthouse audits — all through a simple tool interface.

```bash
BROWSERLESS_TOKEN=your-token npx browserless-mcp
```

The MCP server works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, and any other MCP-compatible client. It exposes the following tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browserless_smartscraper` | Scrape any webpage using cascading strategies (HTTP fetch, proxy, headless browser, captcha solving) |
| `browserless_search` | Search the web and optionally scrape each result with geo-targeting and time filters |
| `browserless_map` | Discover and map all URLs on a website via sitemaps and link extraction |
| `browserless_crawl` | Crawl an entire website with depth control, path filtering, and configurable scrape options |
| `browserless_performance` | Run Lighthouse audits for accessibility, best practices, performance, PWA, and SEO |

For setup instructions and configuration options, see the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browserless.io/mcp/overview) or the [`browserless-mcp` repository](https://github.com/browserless/browserless-mcp).

## 💡 Why Browserless?

**Running Chrome in the cloud or CI sucks.**

Missing fonts. Random crashes. Dependency hell. Lambda limits. You know the drill.

**Browserless solves this** by handling browsers as a managed service — locally or in our cloud — so you can focus on automation, not infrastructure. We've taken care of the hard parts: system packages, font libraries, security patches, scaling strategies, and CVEs.

You still own your script. You still control your code. We just make sure the Browser runs smoothly, every time.

## 📜 Licensing

SPDX-License-Identifier: SSPL-1.0 OR Browserless Commercial License.

If you want to use Browserless to build commercial sites, applications, or in a continuous-integration system that's closed-source then you'll need to purchase a commercial license. This allows you to keep your software proprietary whilst still using browserless. [You can purchase a commercial license here](https://www.browserless.io/contact). A commercial license grants you:

- Priority support on issues and features.
- On-premise running as well as running on public cloud providers for commercial/CI purposes for proprietary systems.
- Ability to modify the source (forking) for your own purposes.
- A new admin user-interface.

Not only does it grant you a license to run such a critical piece of infrastructure, but you are also supporting further innovation in this space and our ability to contribute to it.

If you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the Server Side License 1.0, you may use Browserless under those terms.
